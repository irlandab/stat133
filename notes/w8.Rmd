Introduction to loops
================

For Loops
---------

The anatomy of a `for` loop is as follows:

``` r
for (iterator in times) { 
  do_something
}
```

`for()` takes an **iterator** variable and a vector of **times** to iterate through.

``` r
value <- 2

for (i in 1:5) { 
  value <- value * 2 
  print(value)
}
```

    ## [1] 4
    ## [1] 8
    ## [1] 16
    ## [1] 32
    ## [1] 64

The vector of *times* does NOT have to be a numeric vector; it can be any vector

### For Loops and Next statement

Sometimes we need to skip a loop iteration if a given condition is met, this can be done with a next statement

``` r
for (iterator in times) { 
  expr1
  expr2
  if (condition) {
    next
  }
  expr3
  expr4
}
```

Example:

``` r
x <- 2

for (i in 1:5) {
  y <- x * i
  if (y == 8) {
    next
  }
  print(y)
}
```

    ## [1] 2
    ## [1] 4
    ## [1] 6
    ## [1] 10

### Nested Loops

``` r
for (iterator1 in times1) { 
  for (iterator2 in times2) {
    expr1
    expr2
    ...
  }
}
```

Example: Nested loops

``` r
# some matrix
A <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)

A
```

    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
    ## [1,]    1    4    7   10
    ## [2,]    2    5    8   11
    ## [3,]    3    6    9   12

Example: Nested Loops

``` r
# reciprocal of values less than 6
for (i in 1:nrow(A)) { 
  for (j in 1:ncol(A)) {
    if (A[i,j] < 6) A[i,j] <- 1 / A[i,j] 
  }
}

A
```

    ##           [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
    ## [1,] 1.0000000 0.25    7   10
    ## [2,] 0.5000000 0.20    8   11
    ## [3,] 0.3333333 6.00    9   12

Repeat Loop
-----------

`repeat` executes the same code over and over until a stop condition is met:

``` r
repeat { 
  # keep
  # doing
  # something
  if (stop_condition) {
    break
  }
}
```

The `break` statement stops the loops. If you enter an infinite loop, you can manually break it by pressing the `ESC` key.

``` r
value <- 2

repeat {
  value <- value * 2 
  print(value)
  if (value >= 40) {
    break
  }
}
```

While Loops
-----------

It can also be useful to repeat a computation until a condition is false. A `while` loop provides this form of control flow.

``` r
while (condition) { 
  # keep
  # doing
  # something
  # until
  # condition is FALSE
}
```

Repeat, While, For
------------------

-   If you don't know the number of times something will be done, you can use either `repeat` or `while`
-   `while` evaluates the condition at the beginning
-   `repeat` executes operations until a stop condition is met
-   If you know the number of times that something will be done, use `for`
-   `for` needs an *iterator* and a vector of *times*

More about functions
================

Function Arguments
------------------

If you specify an argument with no default value, you must give it a value everytime you call the function, otherwise you'll get an error:

``` r
sqr <- function(x) { 
  y <- x^2
  return(y)
}

# be careful
sqr()
```

    ## Error in sqr(): argument "x" is missing, with no default

Sometimes you don't want to give default values, but you also don't want to cause an error. We can use `missing()` to see if an argument is missing:

``` r
abc <- function(a, b, c = 3) {
  if (missing(b)) {
    result <- a * 2 + c 
  } else {
    result <- a * b + c 
  }
  return(result)
}
```

You can also set an argument value to NULL if you don't want to specify a default value:

``` r
abcd <- function(a, b = 2, c = 3, d = NULL) {
  if (is.null(d)) {
    result <- a * b + c
  } else {
    result <- a * b + c * d
  }
  return(result)
}
```

- named (default) arguments are created by naming the argument inside `function()`
- unmaned arguments are positional arguments
- Arguments can be matched positionally or by name

Messages
---------

There are two main functions for generating warnings and errors:

-   `stop()`
-   `warning()`
-   There's also the `stopifnot()` function

### Stop Execution

Use `stop()` to stop the execution (this will raise an error)

``` r
meansd <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("x is not numeric")
  }
  # output
  c(mean = mean(x, na.rm = na.rm),
    sd = sd(x, na.rm = na.rm))
}
```

### Warning Messages

Use `warning()` to show a warning message

``` r
meansd <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    warning("non-numeric input coerced to numeric")
    x <- as.numeric(x) 
  }
  # output
  c(mean = mean(x, na.rm = na.rm),
    sd = sd(x, na.rm = na.rm))
}
```

A warning is useful when you don't want to stop the execution, but you still want to show potential problems

### Function `stopifnot()`

`stopifnot()` ensures the truth of expressions:

``` r
meansd <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
  # output
  c(mean = mean(x, na.rm = na.rm),
    sd = sd(x, na.rm = na.rm)) 
}

meansd('hello')
```

    ## Error: is.numeric(x) is not TRUE

Iteration
==========

### Map Functions

The pattern of looping over a vector, doing something to each element and saving the results is so common that the purrr package provides a family of functions to do it for you. There is one function for each type of output:

`map()` makes a list.  
`map_lgl()` makes a logical vector.  
`map_int()` makes an integer vector.  
`map_dbl()` makes a double vector.  
`map_chr()` makes a character vector.

Each function takes a vector as input, applies a function to each piece, and then returns a new vector thatâ€™s the same length (and has the same names) as the input. The type of the vector is determined by the suffix to the map function.

Example:  

``` r
map_dbl(df, mean)
``` 

       a       b       c       d   
  0.2026 -0.2068  0.1275 -0.0917
